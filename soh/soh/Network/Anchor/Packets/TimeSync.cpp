/**
 * TIME_SYNC
 *
 * Sent by the HOST to all clients every ~3 seconds (60 frames) when
 * "Sync Day/Night Cycle" is enabled.
 *
 * Payload:
 *   dayTime  – current gSaveContext.dayTime on the host
 *   frozen   – true if either player is in a timeless scene
 *              (gTimeIncrement == 0, i.e. dungeon / indoor / village)
 *
 * Rules:
 *   1. If EITHER player is in a timeless scene, dayTime is frozen for BOTH.
 *      The host undoes the Environment_Update() increment each frame until
 *      both are in time-advancing scenes again.
 *   2. The client simply overwrites its local dayTime with the received value
 *      and also suppresses its own local advancement when frozen == true.
 *
 * "Timeless scene" detection: gTimeIncrement is set to 0 by the game engine
 * for every indoor, dungeon, and fixed-time overworld area.  No hardcoded
 * scene list is needed – the engine already does the bookkeeping.
